# Look at the cool stuff i done
- Created 3 APIs for `/get-products`, `/cart`, `/cart/update`
- Project is segregated into following folders: <br>
&nbsp; 1. `routes`: To create `cart` and `product` routes in the node application <br>
&nbsp; 2. `entities`: To declare structure for `cart` and `product` entities <br>
&nbsp; 3. `controllers`: To write logic for above routes <br>
&nbsp; 4. `__mockdata__`: Stored sample test data here <br>
&nbsp; 4. `__testcode__`: Stored practice test code here <br>
<br> <br>
Apart from above, I installed the following tools: <br>
- `sonarqube-scanner`: To check code quality and static analysis <br>
- `eslint`: To check syntax and enforce code style

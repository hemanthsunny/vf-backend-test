# Look at the cool stuff i done
- Created 3 APIs for `/get-products`, `/cart`, `/cart/update`
- Project is segregated into following folders: \n
&nbsp; 1. `routes`: To create `cart` and `product` routes in the node application \n
&nbsp; 2. `entities`: To declare structure for `cart` and `product` entities \n
&nbsp; 3. `controllers`: To write logic for above routes \n
&nbsp; 4. `__mockdata__`: Stored sample test data here \n
&nbsp; 4. `__testcode__`: Stored practice test code here \n
\n \n
Apart from above, I installed the following tools: \n
- `sonarqube-scanner`: To check code quality and static analysis \n
- `eslint`: To check syntax and enforce code style
